### Notes about iterm2

If you run the playbook you will have the plist file in your .config. Just make sure
you go to `general > preferences` and select `load preferences from a custom URL`. Then 
select the ~drio/.config directory and exit. When you restart iterm2, you should have 
the preferences loaded.
