Just some notes on my mutt setup.

You need:

1. mutt (+ patches):

  $ sudo port install mutt-devel +ssl +headercache +smtp

2. msmtp: You tell mutt to use msmtp to send email

3. fetchmail: fetch email from different places

4. Procmail: resent the email to gmail (so everything is in
one place).

This setup would work just fine if your sysadmins lock 
(for whatever reason) the gmail servers.
